* Configuration
All configuration for this example blog is contained inside =.dir-locals.el=.

#+INCLUDE: ./.dir-locals.el src emacs-lisp

The export is started via the =export= target in the =Makefile=.
#+INCLUDE: ../Makefile src makefile

As you can see =face-spec-set-match-display= has been overriden to always
return =t=. This is not a requirement of =ox-blog= but a workaround to a
limitation of exporting from =emacs --batch=.

To export highlighted code blocks a theme has to be loaded. Sadly, =emacs
--batch= claims to have a monochrome display - which makes face
definitions restricted to color displays not apply. Overriding
=face-spec-set-match-display= is just a way of getting these faces
applied nonetheless.
